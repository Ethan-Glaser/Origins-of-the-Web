            <h2>Internet vs World Wide Web</h2>
            <p class="left">Many people consider the Internet and the World Wide Web to be synonymous with each other. Although at first appearance these two things may appear to be the same the World Wide Web and the Internet are very different from each other. The Internet is the backbone of how all online applications, like the World Wide Web function. It is a set of protocols that are layered on top of one another to provide a seamless way for client to interact with a server from anywhere at any time. The World Wide Web is an application on the top layer of the Internet. It was developed using protocols that were already developed for the Internet, and then expands on them. The World Wide Web is a “web” of hypertext documents that are interlinked with each other that end up providing the connection and communication we take for granted in our day to day lives. The Internet all started back in the 1960’s when the need for widespread communication was becoming a problem. During this time, research was being done to find a more efficient way of data communication over the method at the time of circuit switching. Researchers Leonard Klienrock, Paul Baran, and Donald Davies broke down the current system of circuit switching. By analyzing the individual traffic of a single node, they determined that it was more efficient to break data up into pieces or “packets” and send it that way. Then came along DARPA, the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. During the Cold War, DARPA needed a way to link information that they had on computers to people across the country. DARPA took the research that Klienrock and his colleagues came up with and built upon it to create the ARPANET, what is now known as the Internet.</p>

            <p class="left">Once the main protocols of the Internet were working, it was time to add some protocols that would give the Internet some functionality. The first of these protocols was email. Email was the first way for a user to send a message to another user over the Internet. Email was a huge milestone in computing because it was the first time that people were able to communicate with each other using machines that have no physical link to one another. The next protocol to be implemented was Telnet. Telnet is a text-based protocol that is used to transfer data from one system to another. Telnet is important because its structure laid the foundations of most of the important protocols we use today on the Internet including HTTP, FTP, and POP3. Telnet was short lived, however, since the information was sent over plain text and as the Internet grew in popularity, people soon realized that this is not a secure protocol.  The predecessor of Telnet was SSH. SSH is a similar protocol to Telnet, except SSH encrypts the message using a form of encryption called private public key cryptography. This method of cryptography allows the computers to send and receive encrypted messages without having the same encryption key. SSH is still used today in common web practice, but for networks that have high latency SSH can be very slow.</p>

            <p class="left">FTP and HTTP were the next two protocols to be created and their functionality has had some of the biggest impact on our modern-day Internet. FTP stands for file transfer protocol and is the way that files are transferred from one location to another without having to be physically connected to the source. FTP opened a new way for people to share their works that they have created. Before FTP sharing a file, like a song or a picture, via the Internet was not able to be done. Then HTTP came along which led to the creation of what we now know as the World Wide Web. Up until this point, the Internet was very efficient in sending data from one place to another, but there wasn’t a way to send things that were all linked or connected with each other. This is where Hypertext comes in, text that isn’t liner, but rather contains links to other text or images. With HTTP, computers now had a way to send this hypertext from one place to another. This led to the creation of a “web” of information, where one person could link and group different text and images together. So, the World Wide Web is not the Internet, rather a creation built upon the structure of the Internet. With rise in popularity, eventually browsers were developed, like gopher and mosaic, that would search for a specific HTTP that a user wanted and send it back to them. This access to fast and unlimited information is what made the World Wide Web boom and is why it is such an important influence on our daily lives.</p>
